Project will be processing streaming data in real time. One of the first requirements is to get access to the streaming data; in this case, tweets. I will be simulating real-time streaming of tweets so that we have a consistent dataset. 

In addition, I will also be using Kafka to buffer the tweets before processing. Kafka provides a distributed queuing service which can be used to store the data when the data creation rate is more than processing rate. It also has several other uses. Read about the basics of Kafka (Introduction up to QuickStart) from the official documentation.
